  ## Description 
  In today's day in age, we have social network applications such as Facebook, Instagram and other applications similar to them. Being able to build the back end part of a social network application has been a challenge, but rewarding at the same time. It gives the users the ability to create a user, create a comment, delete a user, add a friend and also adding a reaction as well. These are just some of the features in the back end part of this application. I learned how to incorporate express for routing, using the Mongoose ODM and utilizing a MongoDB database for storing the different user information.

  ## Installation
  The dependencies that were used in this project were express, moment and mongoose. I inputted npm init -y, then npm i express, npm i moment and npm i mongoose. 

  ## Usage
  The user will need to input npx nodemon server.js into the terminal to start the server. Once the server has been started, the user will then head over to Insomina to test the different routes. The user will also need to connect to the MongoDB to make sure the information is being saved. I have added a link https://youtu.be/wQ20qS_4Uas to the video with a demonstration of how the different routes allow the user to get requested information from Insomnia.

I have attached a screenshot that shows an example of a second user being created along with the current users showing up in the MongoDB database. The video demonstration that has been uploaded to youtube shows how the application operates.

  ## Contribution
  I have attached a link https://github.blog/2012-09-17-contributing-guidelines/ with the contribution guidelines.

  ## Tests
  The steps that were taken was trail and error. I would input npx nodemon server.js and then test out the different routes. I would write a couple parts to the user and thought route at a time to see what was working and what was not.

  ## Questions
  Is it hard to make a back end for a social network?
